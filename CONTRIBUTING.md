## Security and Privacy

We take the security of Werbot code, software, and cloud platform very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Werbot, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report any issues or vulnerabilities to security@werbot.com, instead of posting a public issue in GitHub. Please include the Werbot version identifier, and details on how the vulnerability can be exploited.

When developing, make sure to follow the best industry standards and practices.

## External dependencies

Please avoid introducing new dependencies to Werbot without consulting the team. New dependencies can be very helpful but also introduce new security and privacy issues, complexity, and impact total docker image size. Adding a new dependency should have vital value on the product with minimum possible risk.

## Introducing new features

We would you to contribute to Werbot, but we would also like to make sure Werbot is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement. For us to find the right balance, please open a question on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/werbot/werbot/discussions) with any ideas before introducing a new pull request. This will allow the Werbot community to have sufficient discussion about the new feature value and how it fits in the product roadmap and vision.

This is also important for the Werbot lead developers to be able to give technical input and different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture.
